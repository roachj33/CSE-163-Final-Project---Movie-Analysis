# Exploration and Analysis of Trends Within the Movie Industry Project
This project is split into 2 python modules. The file titled `Project_main.py`
is the python file that conducts the analysis of the project, where the file
`Project_functions.py` contains all of the functions that are utilized by
`Project_main.py` to perform the analysis of the data. The dataset that
is used in this analysis can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies).

In order to run both modules, it is expected that the user has the following
libraries installed:
* Pandas
* plotly (which can be installed by using the command "conda install -c plotly plotly=4.8.1" from the command terminal)
* numpy
* os
* sklearn

In order to conduct the analysis, the user need only run the `Project_main.py` file.
